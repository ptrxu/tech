<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">Over the past 2-3 years, companies have offered the public different means and options of internet and phone communications. These options provide, in most cases, faster and more cost effective services to the end user. Unknowingly, these new advancements in technology have caused significant problems throughout the security industry. The following outlines different internet/phone services, how they affect the security system and recommendations and solutions that we can provide our customers that opt to take advantage of these technologies.</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>VOIP</b> (Voice Over Internet Protocol)</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">VOIP is defined as phone service over the internet. Customers often refer to VOIP as having digital phone lines.</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>Effects on the alarm system:</b></font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>?</b> Failure of internet service will disrupt phone service and the alarm panel will no longer communicate.</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">? Failure of the VOIP module will disrupt phone service and the ability of the alarm panel to communicate.</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">? VOIP modules will often have no battery backup installed and any disruption of AC power to the home will disrupt phone service and the ability of the alarm panel to communicate.</font>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">? Due to the several standards used by Cable and DSL providers and differences in alarm panel design we may have instances where an alarm panel will not properly communicate using VOIP.</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>Resolution:</b></font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">Customers that utilize VOIP as their means of phone communication have 2 options in ensuring that their alarm system communicates with our monitoring station:</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">The customer can have a cellular backup unit (<b>7845GSM</b>) to be installed and used as the primary means to communicate with Monitronics. The cellular back up has a battery back up along with the alarm system and if the customer experiences a power outage, the alarm would still communicate through the cellular backup. The cost (parts and labor) of adding a cell back up unit is approximately <b>$350.00</b>, along with an additional <b>$10.00</b> monthly charge to the customer.</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>Special Note:</b> Even though the alarm system would be able to communicate using VOIP service, if the customer experienced an A/C power loss the alarm system would not be able to communicate with Monitronics. The customer should be advised that if they opt to purchase the necessary equipment to have their signals communicate through the internet, they should either have their modem connected to a back up power supply to insure that if there is a power loss the system would be able to communicate, or have a cell back up unit installed along with the other equipment as a back means of communication.</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">? If the customer does not have a compatible Honeywell Ademco system then they only have one option:</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">Sales add on for a cellular back up unit (<b>7845CV2</b>) to be installed and used as the primary means to communicate with Monitronics. <b>(Cost: Approx $350)</b></font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">DSL is phone service over regular phone lines (POTS) Plain Old Telephone Line Service. DSL can be configured in one of two ways:</font>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">The phone company can come out and split the data from the analog outside the house where the DSL signal comes straight to one phone jack in the house. (This configuration would not require a DSL filter per all phone jacks have no data being sent to them because it was split out side the house, only the jack where the computer is plugged into has the DSL signal. (<i>Split configuration</i>)</font>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">The DSL provider will send the data and analog signals together where the DSL data will be sent through the home to all phone jacks on the same phone jacks on the same phone line. This would require a DSL filter to filter out the data. (<i>Most common configuration</i>)</font>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1"><b>Cable internet</b> is internet service provided over the coax connection not the phone lines. In this configuration the phone does not travel over the coax cable, just the internet. The phone line is separate from the internet.</font>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="1">Security systems can communicate to the monitoring station, if cable internet is installed, without adding any additional equipment to the alarm system. However, in the event of a power loss, if the converter for the cable does not have a back up power supply, the alarm system will not be able to communicate.</font>
